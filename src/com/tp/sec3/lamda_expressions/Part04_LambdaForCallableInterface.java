 * The difference between Runnable interface and callable interface is that Runnable interface run() method doesn't return a value while Callable class call method return a value.
 * Apart from that call() method can throw exception whereas run() method cannot.
 * But the main difference between them is Runnable interface can be used to create thread but Callable interface not.
 * So to use Callable interface we will need 'ExecutorService' to create thread pool where we can submit Callable object and 'Future' to get and hold the call() method response which main thread can use.
 * These can be used with Runnable also.
